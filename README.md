Welcome to Digital Logic Design, Embedded Systems & Firmware Engineering, an open-source learning eBook for electronics enthusiasts, students, and hobbyists. This repository provides step-by-step tutorials, projects, and experiments spanning:

Digital Logic Design: logic gates, flip-flops, counters, and shift registers

Embedded Systems & Firmware: microcontroller projects, GPIO, PWM, ADC, and interfacing ICs

Sensors & Actuators: reading temperature, light, and other sensor data; controlling LEDs, motors, and buzzers

Electrochemistry Experiments: safe demonstrations of electrolytes and basic chemical reactions for electronics applications

State Machines & System Design: practical applications of sequential logic in circuits and firmware

All projects are designed to be educational, hands-on, and open-source, enabling learners to explore, modify, and expand on the experiments. Contributions and improvements from the community are welcome!
